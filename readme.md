This is the Ordr.in sample mobile applciation
It is a web app deployed using phoneGap
currently it only supports the iPhone but there is no reason why it couldnt support Android, webOS, or any other webkit browser OS

Status:
The app is fully functional in Chrome but contains some bugs on the iPhone
Various iPhone bug fixes are being worked on in different branches
It has not yet been tested on a physical iPhone

Getting Started:
The  app is built on top of the Ordrin Javascript API and jQuery Mobile. However you should be able to use most of the javascript in this app in your own application regardless of if it is mobile or based on jQuery
